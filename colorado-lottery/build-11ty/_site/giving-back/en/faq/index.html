    At its core, the Colorado Lottery is a conservation organization. In fact, it's the only Lottery in the country dedicated to funding the great outdoors. Since 1983, the Colorado Lottery has given more than $4 billion back to parks, trails, open spaces and recreation projects across the state. Profits from the sale of Lottery games in the state are distributed to voter-selected beneficiaries who use those funds to preserve and protect Colorado.

          Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Great Outdoors Colorado funds projects that impact communities across the state. The Colorado Lottery is GOCO's only funding source and provides GOCO with 50 percent of its proceeds, up to a $35 million cap in 1992 dollars, adjusted for inflation. If this percentage exceeds the adjusted cap, the remainder is distributed to the State Public School Capital Construction Assistance Fund. In FY21, the distribution to GOCO was $71.7 million.

          The Conservation Trust Fund receives 40 percent of Lottery proceeds. Local parks and recreation providers receive money from the Conservation Trust Fund in proportion to their population so that every town, city, county and special district in Colorado benefits. The Lottery distributed more than $67.7 million to the fund in FY21 for open space and land acquisition, equipment purchases, facility development, park maintenance and renovation or restoration of local facilities.

        <p>
          Colorado Parks and Wildlife receives 10 percent of Lottery proceeds and also receives Lottery spillover funds once the GOCO cap is met. Colorado's 42 state parks use Lottery money for trail construction and maintenance, land acquisition, equipment and facility purchases and maintenance of state parks facilities. Lottery funding improves the state park experience for more than 12 million annual visitors. The Lottery distributed approximately $16.9 million in FY21 to Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife before spillover funds.

  <div class="accordion">
    <a class="h3 trigger" href="#">Can I get free Lottery tickets, water bottles, hats, etc. for my non-profit or social group?</a>
    <div class="response">
      <p>Unfortunately, no. The Lottery is a government agency, and we are not able to donate free items to many good causes such as yours. We do apologize. It is a rule that Lottery proceeds go to parks, trails, and the outdoors in Colorado. We have to make sure that any sponsored events or giveaways have a direct proceeds or Lottery retailer tie-in. As you can imagine, our inventory and budget is planned by the Department of Revenue in advance, and it is frequently audited. But we appreciate you thinking of us.</p>

  <div class="accordion">
    <a class="h3 trigger" href="#">Can I recommend a project to receive Lottery funding?</a>
    <div class="response">
      <p>The Colorado Lottery does not determine where proceeds funding goes. As funds are allocated via different agencies and to different local entities, it is advised that interested citizens contact their local municipalities to learn about the process for requesting projects. For example, if you are interested in pursuing a local park, please contact your local parks and recreation department. </p>
