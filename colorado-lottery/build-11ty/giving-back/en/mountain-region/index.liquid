  <p>The heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a place like no other. Whether you’re hiking, climbing, rafting, skiing or just driving through, it’s easy to get lost in a sense of wonder while gazing up at, or surveying over the sparkling blue lakes and massive peaks of gray, white and green.</p>

        <p>
          Howelsen Hill Ski Area is owned and operated by the City of Steamboat Springs and holds a unique place in the history of skiing. The complex includes rodeo grounds, ice skating complex, terrain park, and one of the largest alpine training facilities in North America. More than $1 million in Lottery proceeds helped make it what it is today. Howelsen Hill is Colorado’s oldest continuously operated ski area since 1915, and has the largest and most complete natural ski jumping complex in North America. Howelsen has been the training ground for nearly 90 Olympians with over 150 Winter Olympic appearances, 22 members of the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame, and 13 members of the National Ski Hall of Fame.

          River Park in Breckenridge
        </p>

        <p>
          River Park in Breckenridge is a local oasis connecting the workforce housing units with the Breckenridge Rec Center and several schools. Although Breckenridge has a population of 4,700 residents, there are more than three million visitors each year, making River Park both a neighborhood jewel and a destination spot. Two separate Lottery-funded grants totaling $700,000 went into creating the park. The park’s play area integrates natural features, landscape and vegetation, giving children easy access to nature and the outdoors. The playground is artfully designed with woodcarvings, nature-based play structures, and climbing towers that are visible from Highway 9. The park also provides picnic areas, pavilion, restrooms, and ADA-accessible fishing landing. A new bike and pedestrian bridge connects to a recreation path that sees 20,000 users in the summer season alone. River Park won the Town of Breckenridge a 2019 Lottery Starburst Award for demonstrating excellence in the use of lottery funds.

        <p>
          Since 2012, GOCO has invested more than $9 million in Lottery proceeds into the completion of the Clear Creek Canyon Segment of the <a href="https://youtu.be/wyJEGj-SD3M" target="_blank">Peaks to Plains Trail</a>, a legacy trail project that will offer visitors a truly quintessential Colorado experience as a world-class recreation destination. The vision of the Peaks to Plains Trail is a 65-mile trail of statewide significance that will one day connect the South Platte Trail in Denver to the headwaters of Clear Creek at Loveland Pass. Once fully complete, it will connect four counties and seven cities, with a total elevation gain of more than 1 mile.

        </p>

        <p><a href="https://visitglenwood.com/hanginglake/" target="_blank">Hanging Lake</a> is one of Colorado's most cherished hiking and waterfall destinations. A rocky, 1.2-mile climb leads to a serene oasis where waterfalls cascade into a breathtaking blue-green lake, making it a must-visit spot for nature lovers.</p>
        <p>The past four years have been tough on Hanging Lake. In 2020, the Grizzly Creek fire ravaged 33,000 acres in the surrounding areas and subsequent floods caused intermittent closures, severely limiting public access.</p>
        <p>Now, thanks to the support of the Colorado Lottery and its partners, Hanging Lake is set to receive a $4.5 million restoration. Key improvements include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replacing bridges to ensure safe passage</li>
          <li>Adding a boardwalk to protect the delicate ecosystem</li>
          <li>Rebuilding sections of the trail to enhance the hiking experience</li>
          <li>Implementing measures to protect the surrounding forest</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Restoring and upgrading the trail ensures that this natural treasure remains accessible, safe, and sustainable for future generations to enjoy. The project is slated to be complete in fall 2024.</p>

        <p>The new <a href="https://crownmtn.org/" target="_blank">Crown Mountain Bike Park</a> in El Jebel, which boasts more than 10 different features for all levels of experience, was an ambitious project that repurposed underutilized space into a world-class bike park. The Crown Mountain Park & Recreation District was committed to building a bike park, reviving the land, and transforming it into a space that would serve thousands of people. This year-round, affordable, and multigenerational community amenity offers vast health and recreation opportunities that eliminate barriers to biking by also offering free access to equipment and facilities. This bike park expansion strengthens the Ride Center’s Gold Level scoring during future evaluations while creating a place for our youngest generation to learn, train, and benefit from multiple aspects of cycling culture in a safe environment.</p>
