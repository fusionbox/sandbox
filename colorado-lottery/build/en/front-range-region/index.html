            <p>The East Plum Creek Trail in Castle Rock extends the trail system two miles to the south along the East Plum Creek corridor, with 99% of the trail on public open space. The East Plum Creek Trail is open to walkers, joggers, and bicyclists and is ADA-accessible. It offers a variety of outdoor programming activities; is a safe, off-street route to travel between neighborhoods by bike; and connects area residents to Castle Rock’s Historic Downtown.</p>

            </p>

            <p>A crown jewel of Littleton, Clement Park is more than lawns and playgrounds - it’s a community hub. In just the past few years, the Lottery has invested $700,000 in two major projects at Clement Park. </p>
            <p>First is the Interactive Water Feature, which replaced the park’s nearly 30-year-old water fountain. Interweaving natural environmental elements into an urban area, stainless steel curvatures represent the mountains to the west as a large steel arch supplies a curtain of water. Hand-selected local boulders line the river channel along with concrete seating structures. The splash pad includes various types of sprays, a linear stream, and a waterfall. </p>

            <article class="image-container"><div class="wrapped"><img src="../../assets/images/Clement Park.webp" alt="Clement Park in Littleton" /></div></article>

            <p>The Lottery also helped fund Clement Park’s Inclusive Destination Playground, a renovated space for children of all ages and abilities. The playground features unique, performing arts-themed experiences which include an interactive xylophone, a trombone climber, and a mini amphitheatre that allows kids to put on their own shows. Clement Park receives over a million visitors each year, making it the most highly used park in the district.</p>

            <p>Barr Lake is the only state park in Adams County and has something for every type of outdoors enthusiast.</p>
            <p>Bicyclists, nature hikers and horseback riders enjoy the level 8.8-mile multi-use trail that circles the lake, passing by several wildlife viewing stations and the park's wildlife refuge. Bird watchers visit to see the more than 350 species of birds that have been spotted in the park, including numerous bald eagles. Fishing enthusiasts and boaters, including kayakers and canoeists, enjoy the lake's calm waters year round.</p>

            <p>Barr Lake also offers a 90-foot-long fishing pier that accommodates all park visitors, including those with mobility challenges. Previously, wheelchair inaccessibility for fishing was a frequent complaint at the park, and often required having to turn people away. The Colorado Lottery is proud to have helped fund the care and preservation of Barr Lake State Park as well as provide accessibility to all its visitors. <a href="https://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/barrlake" target="_blank">Learn more about Barr Lake State Park</a>.</p>

            <p>Two-time Starburst Award recipient, Prospect Park, has benefitted from more than $1.2 million in Lottery funding through GOCO and CTF since 2017. Situated in Wheat Ridge, this regional park offers diverse amenities and is located adjacent to the 300-acre Wheat Ridge Greenbelt, which connects to the Peaks to Plains Trail.</p>

            <p>Phase 2 of the renovation began in November 2021, focusing on several key upgrades. These included the replacement of the picnic pavilion and the eastern playground, conversion of the tennis court into six pickleball courts, the addition of two shelters and a fishing dock, enhancement to the park entrance, improved vehicle and pedestrian paths, and overall improvements to irrigation and landscaping throughout the park.</p>

            <p>Annually, nearly 45,000 residents and visitors flock to Prospect Park, drawn by its myriad offerings. The renovations have expanded opportunities for people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities to enjoy the park.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Lottery proceeds totaling over $260,000 fully funded and completed multiple projects in and around Evergreen Lake. Projects focused on rehabilitating the heavily used trails, boardwalks, park, and shoreline of Evergreen Lake, which served as the centerpiece of Evergreen's scenic park and recreation system. As part of this rehabilitation, damaged trails and fencing were repaired, social trails were eliminated, boardwalks were made safe, and erosion control measures were implemented. Youth corps members also had the opportunity to be involved in unique daily environmental education activities through a partnership with the Evergreen Nature Center located on the shore of Evergreen Lake.</p>

            <p>Evergreen Park and Recreation District was also awarded a GOCO grant for improvements to the Evergreen Lake Loop trail, a 1.3-mile trail encircling Evergreen Lake, the town's premier community gathering spot. Improvements included trail restoration, repairing existing boardwalks, and replacing an existing, steep, steel staircase north of the Evergreen Dam with an accessible trail. All park users benefited from the improvements, which provided safer access to environmental, educational, and historical sites along the Loop Trail.</p>

Maximizing a $350,000 grant in Lottery funding through GOCO, in partnership with the Trust for Public Land and RISE Coalition, the City engaged in a park discovery process gathering public input and developing designs for a park that inspires safe outdoor recreation and play. The community rallied around the project, which aimed to promote recreational equity and wellness.</p>

            <p>The 13.5 acre renovated park now boasts innovative features like a universal playground, a bike skills course integrated with stormwater management, and a youth-designed skate park, promoting inclusivity and community ownership. Sustainability measures such as native grass, artificial turf, and shade structures were implemented, along with a community-led tile art project celebrating diversity.</p>
